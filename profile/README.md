# Welcome to the AltLayer org repos!

AltLayer is a decentralized and elastic Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) protocol for application developers to launch highly scalable application-tailored execution layers (aka Layer 2s). 

Built on top of the RaaS protocol, AltLayer offers:
- an SDK for developers who wish to manage their rollups themselves, and
- a no-code dashboard that allows not only developers but also those with little to no coding experience to spin up a customized execution layer within 2 mins through a few simple clicks.

AltLayer uses optimistic rollup execution model under the hood but it is a completely independent implementation. It also comes with a dedicated sequencer network called *Beacon Chain* that provides sequencing services to the rollups instantiated by AltLayer. Core components of AltLayer are built from scratch and can support both WASM and EVM runtimes making it possible to support Layer 1s beyond EVM chains.
